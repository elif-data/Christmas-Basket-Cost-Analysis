ðŸ“Š Christmas Basket Cost Analysis ðŸŽ„ 

I compared the cost of an average Christmas basket across UK grocery stores, and found some interesting stuff!

I googled "Christmas dinner ingredients" for this analysis and picked a few items from this list.

I also allowed for a bottle of Chardonnay (11%) per person and nibbles such as mixed nuts, cheese and biscuits.



From the picked 15 items available in all markets and filled the basket for a six-person dinner party picking the most cost-friendly options. Items are: 

frozen turkey
white potatoes
stuffing mix
pack of mince pies
carrots
Brussels sprouts
red cabbage
parsnips
pigs in blankets
salted butter
cranberry sauce
turkey gravy
biscuits for cheese
cheese collection
mixed nuts

This analysis highlights Sainsburyâ€™s effort to stay competitive, and how our perceptions of affordability may differ from reality!
