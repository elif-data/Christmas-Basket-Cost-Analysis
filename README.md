📊 Christmas Basket Cost Analysis 🎄 

I compared the cost of an average Christmas basket across UK grocery stores, and here’s what I found:

➡️ Asda is still the cheapest - if we compare original costs.

➡️ Sainsbury's is the cheapest, by a small margin, thanks to their extremely competitive discounts!

➡️ Morrisons, M&S, Ocado, and Waitrose are in the expected order.

For this analysis, I googled "Christmas dinner ingredients", picked 15 items available in all markets and filled the basket for a six-person dinner party picking the most cost-friendly options. Items are: 

frozen turkey
white potatoes
stuffing mix
pack of mince pies
carrots
Brussels sprouts
red cabbage
parsnips
pigs in blankets
salted butter
cranberry sauce
turkey gravy
biscuits for cheese
cheese collection
mixed nuts

This analysis highlights Sainsbury’s effort to stay competitive, and how our perceptions of affordability may differ from reality!
