## üìä Christmas Basket Cost Analysis üéÑ 

I compared the cost of an average Christmas basket across UK grocery stores, and found some interesting stuff!

I googled "Christmas dinner ingredients" to see the most common things people may shop for Christmas and filled the basket for a six-person dinner party.

I also allowed 3 bottles of white wine (11%) per person and nibbles such as mixed nuts, cheese and biscuits.

To ensure fairness:

- I focused on the total basket cost, excluding delivery charges.
- I allowed both loyalty and Christmas discounts.
- I did not include multi-buy deals; as none of the items in my basket fit.
- I picked the most cost-friendly options, items within a similar range in quality and weight.
- I standardized the weights of items by assuming all would be the same weight.
> ``` For example, most markets had an option for frozen turkey to feed six people, but Waitrose only offered two options, one for 4 servings and the other for 8. I calculated the mean price per kilo for these options, then scaled it to a 2 kg turkey, as Google and all the other grocery shops claim 2 kg Turkey would feed six people. Similarly, I normalized weights where packaging differed (e.g., mixed nuts were standardized to 300g across all markets). ```
- The original price is based on the items' cost without the discount on the 18th of December.
- The Christmas Discount is based on the discounted cost of the items on the 19th of December.

The results were not shocking but it emphasised something rather quite significant.

‚û°Ô∏è Lidl remains the cheapest, with Aldi as the second most affordable, while Waitrose, Ocado and M&S as expected, are the most expensive.
‚û°Ô∏è Interestingly, Tesco is slightly cheaper than Asda due to their aggressive Christmas discounts and "Aldi Price Match" strategy.
‚û°Ô∏è Iceland and Morrisons mostly offer multibuy deals, but none applied to my basket, so they may appear more expensive.

‚û°Ô∏è Lidl and Aldi have the most competitive price for a frozen turkey, which is the most impactful item in the basket as it is the most expensive.

This analysis highlights while expensive chains offer minimal discounts, Tesco, Asda, and Sainsbury's seem to be trying their hardest!
