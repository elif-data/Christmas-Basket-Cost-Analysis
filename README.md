ðŸ“Š Christmas Basket Cost Analysis ðŸŽ„ 

I compared the cost of an average Christmas basket across UK grocery stores, and found some interesting stuff!

I googled "Christmas dinner ingredients" for this analysis and filled the basket for a six-person dinner party.

I also allowed 3 bottles of white wine (11%) per person and nibbles such as mixed nuts, cheese and biscuits.

To ensure fairness:

- I picked the most cost-friendly options, items within a similar range in quality and weight.
- I standardized the weights of items by assuming all would be the same weight.
> ```For example, most markets had an option for frozen turkey to feed six people, but Waitrose only offered two options, one for 4 servings and the other for 8. I calculated the mean price per kilo for these options, then scaled it to a 3kg turkey, as Google claims 3 kg Turkey would feed six people. Similarly, I normalized weights where packaging differed (e.g., mixed nuts were standardized to 300g across all markets). ```
- I focused on the total basket cost, excluding delivery charges.
- I allowed both loyalty and Christmas discounts.
- I did not include multi-buy deals; as none of the items in my basket fit.


- The original price is based on the items' cost without the discount on the 18th of December.
