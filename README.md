📊 Christmas Basket Cost Analysis 🎄 

I compared the cost of an average Christmas basket across UK grocery stores, and here’s what I found:

➡️ Asda is still the cheapest - if we compare original costs.

➡️ Sainsbury's is the cheapest, by a small margin, thanks to their extremely competitive discounts!

➡️ Morrisons, M&S, Ocado, and Waitrose are in the expected order.

This analysis highlights Sainsbury’s effort to stay competitive, and how our perceptions of affordability may differ from reality!

Morrisons rely heavily on multi-buy deals (e.g., 3 for 4 offers) instead of direct price cuts. It must work for them since they have not changed their strategy in years!
